Working through numerous exercises with liberal breaks between intense sessions were the most productive way of applying practice testing. Explaining what I'd learnt to my family members and friends was a grat way of clarifying the concepts as well, as it forces you to go beyind recall, and to construct the idea in your own words. Dual codes helped a lot through the R programming exercises, because even the few basic steps we had to implement on our own required a thorough understanding. This was true for the excellent video series from the game theory web site as well.\n",

Even given the few weeks of study, a fairly strong scaffolding or framework for thinking critically has been built. Formal logic and algorithms are deeply embedded in almost everything that we do, they are just not formally expressed. The ability to 'translate' between the 'messy' real world and clinical world of formal analysis is a powerful tool to make sense of an increasingly complex world.\n",

This causes the deductive argument to be made around a 'toy' scenario with a much more constrained scope than that of the inductive argument. Inductive reasoning gies us the ability to grapple with scenarios that are complex, hard to define, enumerate or otherwise pin down. \n",

Then begins a lengthy interrogation, where the following facts are presented to them (much like the previous problem, the exact facts can be contributed by students over time):\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1. A surveilance camera has captured the image of Biff's car on the same street as the house, on the night of the burglary\n",
    "        2. There is a boot print in the yard that matches the boot of Boff\n",
    "        3. An eyewitness has picked the pair out of a lineup as suspiciously lurking around the house a week before the crime\n",
    "        4. They both have recently bought new gold chains and expensive haircuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Assume you are Biff. Construct a deductive argument to explain the first piece of evidence presented. You can add new premises to the argument as long as the evidence is also referenced in your argument. A particularly perpicacious detective decides to construct a truth table for this. Please draw out the truth table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Assume you are Boff. Construct an inductive argument to explain evidence number 2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. The policemen then leave the room, giving the duo time to get their story straight. Using all the evidence, construct a consistent deductive argument for Biff, and a strong inductive argument for Boff, given their arguments for 1 & 2 as premises. Provide a formal proof for the validity of the deductive argument. Identify the features and type of the inductive argument.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. Now assume that Biff wants to implicate Boff, so he convinces him to introduce an inductive fallacy into his argument. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. Do the same for Boff, by introducing a logical fallacy in Biff's deductive argument. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    7. Identify the fallacies and explain them.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    By setting this argument in an interrogation, the focus is on clarity and consistency. The motivation to introduce fallacies in the arguments is also more natural here, as opposed to just asking for a fallacy to be introduced into some statement for no reason. Lastly the task of combining smaller arguments to form larger ones is an important part of applications in real life, which is not explicitly addressed in the current assignment, the way this one does.\n",
