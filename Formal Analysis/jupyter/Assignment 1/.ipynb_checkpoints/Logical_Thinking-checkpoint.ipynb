    "For one side of the argument, craft two brief arguments (<150 words each) using deductive reasoning. One argument should be a valid deduction and one should contain a fallacy. Write these arguments in natural language in simple terms with clear use of logical connectives and atomic sentences so that it is amenable for the following analysis.\n",
